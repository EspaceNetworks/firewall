The official source for this module is http://git.freepbx.org/projects/FREEPBX/repos/firewall/browse with an additional mirror at https://github.com/freepbx/firewall 

In addition to your rights and obligations under the AGPL, as this module contains 'Non-Source' files (specifically, firewall phars), if you wish to redistribute this module *unmodified*, you may reference either (or both) of those git repositories as a valid 'designated place', as required by Section 6(d) of the AGPLv3, or the equivalent section in any later versions (if required). 

This does not waive your requirements and obligations of section 6 (or the equivalent version) if you wish to redistribute modified versions of this package.
